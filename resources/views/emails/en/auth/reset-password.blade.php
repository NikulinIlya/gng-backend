How do you come up with a password that will protect your account?

Use letters, numbers and other symbols in your password

For an eight-digit password that contains both case letters, numbers and symbols, the number of possible options is 30,000 times greater than if the password had only lowercase letters.

Choose a password that is difficult to guess

Use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols that does not relate to you personally. Take a random word or phrase and add a letter or number to the end, beginning, or middle to get a password that is not easy to guess (for example, sPo0kyh @ ll0w3En).

Store your password in a safe place

Do not leave the password written on paper near the computer. In this case, the password can easily be stolen in order to subsequently hack the account.

Use a password manager for storage.
